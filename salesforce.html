    <h2 class="heading">What is Salesforce</h2>
    <p class="sizing">
      Salesforce is a cloud-based software company that provides businesses with
      tools that help them find more prospects, close more deals, and provide a
      higher level of service to their customers. <br /><br />Salesforce
      services allow businesses to use cloud technology to better connect with
      partners, customers, and potential customers. Using the Salesforce CRM,
      companies can track customer activity, market to customers, and many more
      services. <br /><br />A CRM platform helps you go deeper with all your
      metrics and data; you could also set up a dashboard that showcases your
      data visually. In addition to this, you can also have personalized
      outreach with automation. Another significant benefit is that a CRM
      platform can also improve customer service's ability to help customers or
      a sales team's outreach efforts.
