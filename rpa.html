        <p class="sizing">
          <span class="span">Robotic process automation (RPA)</span> is the
          application of technology that allows employees in a company to
          configure computer software or a “robot” to capture and interpret
          existing applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data,
          triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems.
          <br /><br />
          Any company that uses labor on a large scale for general knowledge
          process work, where people are performing high-volume, highly
          transactional process functions, will boost their capabilities and
          save money and time with robotic process automation software. <br />
          <br />
          Just as industrial robots are remaking the manufacturing industry by
          creating higher production rates and improved quality, RPA “robots”
          are revolutionizing the way we think about and administer business
          processes, IT support processes, workflow processes, remote
          infrastructure and back-office work. RPA provides dramatic
          improvements in accuracy and cycle time and increased productivity in
          transaction processing while it elevates the nature of work by
          removing people from dull, repetitive tasks.
        </p>
        <h2 class="span">
          The technology of RPA can be applied specifically to a wide range of
          industries.

            Technologies like presentation-layer automation software – a
            technology that mimics the steps of a rules-based, non-subjective
            process without compromising the existing IT architecture – are able
            to consistently carry out prescribed functions and easily scale up
            or down to meet demand. Process automation can expedite back-office
            tasks in finance, procurement, supply chain management, accounting,
            customer service and human resources, including data entry, purchase
            order issuing, creation of online access credentials, or business
            processes that require “swivel-chair” access to multiple existing
            systems.

            Automated processes in the remote management of IT infrastructures
            can consistently investigate and solve problems for faster process
            throughput. RPA can improve service desk operations and the
            monitoring of network devices. Separating scalability from human
            resources allows a company to handle short-term demand without extra
            recruiting or training.

            As in voice recognition software or automated online assistants,
            developments in how machines process language, retrieve information
            and structure basic content mean that RPA can provide answers to
            employees or customers in natural language rather than in software
            code. This technology can help to conserve resources for large call
            centers and for customer interaction centers.

        As RPA brings more technologically-advanced solutions to businesses
        around the world, operating models that adopt automation, whether
        in-house or offshored, will cut costs, drive efficiency and improve
        quality.
